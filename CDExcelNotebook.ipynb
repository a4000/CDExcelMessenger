If you use this function, a 'Cleaned' column will be added to the CD compound table that flags the rows in the Compound table that were found in the Excel file. If you run this function a second time, 'Cleaned' will be renamed 'OldCleaned', and a new 'Cleaned' column will be added to the CD compound table.
