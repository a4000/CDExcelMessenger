    "updateCDResultsFile() is the function that allows you to import data from an Excel file into a CD Results file. This function can add new columns to the CD compound table, or update certain columns in the CD compound table (Tags, Checked, Name, or any columns already added by this function). A 'Cleaned' column will be added to the CD compound table that flags the rows in the Compound table that were found in the Excel file. An editible column called 'Notes' will be added to CD by default. A non-editible column called 'originalName' will be added to CD that contains the same data as the Name column. This will allow you to update the Name column while keeping the original Name data. This function also gives you the option of updating the Tag names and values in CD if you use 'tagList'. An MSI column will be added to the CD Results file based on whether or not certain Tags are checked.. If your Excel file doesn't have a 'compoundID' column, this function will add that column (make sure you don't use compoundID for something else).
